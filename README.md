Utilizing Java and Spring Boot, I developed the backend for a sophisticated educational application. This application is architected around the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and enhancing maintainability. For data persistence, I chose MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to effectively handle the applicationâ€™s dynamic and unstructured data. The combination of Java, Spring Boot, and MongoDB allowed for the creation of a scalable and flexible backend that can support complex educational workflows and data interactions. This setup also provides robustness and scalability, making the application capable of handling large volumes of data and user interactions efficiently.
